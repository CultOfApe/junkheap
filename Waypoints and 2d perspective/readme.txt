Done after following the "Gitting gud a Godot"-series by AlexsHoratio:

- LMB to move
- CTRL+ LMB sets waypoints (Setting waypoints while moving caused issues, so player will only move once CTRL is released)
- LMB on Gobot makes him talk (ugly hardcoded dialogue)
- player character sprite will scale according to y position, to simulate actual perspective 
- bug: player will stop moving if you hover over the Gobot

ugly spritesheet is downloaded from: http://www.tahubacemstudio.com/2016/07/free-64-px-character-pixel-base-sprite.html

Will not work on Godot 3.0! Tested and playing fine with 2.3 and 2.4 beta.
