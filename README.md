A repository for various small projects created with the aim to learn Godot, often beginning from online tutorials as a base. I try to give credit where credit is due, but if I forgot someone, give me a shout. Maybe someone will find one or two useful code snippets.
DISCLAIMER: There is a lot of newbie code in these examples, use at your own risk ;)
