Extends Simple Dialogue System (SDS)
- Displays dialogue text and replies in a box
- Dialogue box resizes dynamically to fit more replies
- Select replies with mouse
- Exit dialogue by clicking exit dialogue or ESC

ApeÂ´s Dynamic Dialogue System (ADDS)
- all of the above +
- named dialogues
- Dialogue text paging, allowing for longer dialogue
- Cycle through replies with arrow keys, select with SPACE or ENTER
- change game variables through dialogue decisions
- character progression flags

TODO:
- change "responses" to "replies" in json for consistency
- change names of variables and functions for consistency
	ex.
	vars should be camel case, ie num_replies should be numReplies
	functions should be snake case, ie my_function()
	constants should be upper case, ie viewsize should be VIEWSIZE
- if no replies, clicking on last dialogue page closes down dialogue (Done in local repository)
- add game progression flags, might affect not only characters
	#events can have several stages
	ex:
	"game progression": [{
	"event": "Milk and cookies"
	"stage": 1
	}]
- Dialogue animations should be settable per dialogue branch
	changes DONE in json (local repository). Remains to reflect that change in dialogue.gd

To use in your project (unfinished instructions)

instance dialogue.tscn into your project

add the following script to every Area that contains an NPC:


extends Area2D #obviously change this depending on if its Area or Area2D

signal dialogue(a,b,c)

var identity = {"dialogue": "res://dialogue/npc1.json", "branch": "a", "name": "NPC1"}

func _ready():
	pass

func _on_npc1_input_event( viewport, event, shape_idx ):
	if event.type == InputEvent.MOUSE_BUTTON and event.button_index == BUTTON_LEFT:
		if event.is_pressed():
			emit_signal("dialogue", identity.dialogue, identity.branch, identity.name)
