Example of me taking water over my head :) 

A match 3 game seems easy, I said, lol...

the "game" sets up a grid of labels with a random value, using a dictionary to store position
rudimentary drag and move functionality on labels
check for match-functionality doesn´t really work, but the code I did is still in there
I gave up and moved on, but this is something I´m going to revisit when I´m better at coding! :)
